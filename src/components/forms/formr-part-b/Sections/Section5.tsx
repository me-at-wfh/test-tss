                    <b>Significant Event:</b> The GMC states that a significant
                    event (also known as an untoward or critical incident) is
                    any unintended or unexpected event, which could or did lead
                    to harm of one or more patients. This includes incidents
                    which did not cause harm but could have done, or where the
                    event should have been prevented. All doctors as part of
                    revalidation are required to record and reflect on
                    Significant events in their work with the focus on what you
                    have learnt as a result of those event/s. Use
                    non-identifiable patient data only.

                    <b>Complaints:</b> A complaint is a formal expression of
                    dissatisfaction or grievance. It can be about an individual
                    doctor, the team or about the care of patients where a
                    doctor could be expected to have had influence or
                    responsibility. As a matter of honesty & integrity you are
                    obliged to include all complaints, even when you are the
                    only person aware of them. All doctors should reflect on how
                    complaints influence their practice. Use non-identifiable
                    patient data only.

                    that you feel the ARCP panel or Responsible Officer should
                    be made aware of. Use non-identifiable patient data only.
