        The GDPR requires that data controllers and organisations that process
        personal data demonstrate compliance with its provisions. This involves
        publishing our basis for lawful processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As personal data is processed for the purposes of statutory functions,
        legal bases for the processing of personal data as listed in Article 6
        of the GDPR are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol style={{ listStyle: "none" }}>
        <li>6(1) (a) - Consent of the data subject</li>
        <li>
          6(1) (b) - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
          to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the

        </li>
        <li>
          6(1) (c) - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal

          functions vested on the data controller
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Where special categories of personal data are processed, the additional
        legal bases for processing such data, as listed in Article 9 of the GDPR
        are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol style={{ listStyle: "none" }}>
        <li>9(2) (a) - Explicit consent of the data subject</li>
        <li>
          9(2) (b) - Processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out
          the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of
          the data subject in the field of employment and social security and
          social protection law
        </li>
        <li>
          9(2) (f) - Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or

        ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation
        and data concerning health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that not all the above legal bases will apply for each type
        of processing activity undertaken. However, when processing any personal
        data for any particular purpose, one or more of the above legal bases
        will apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may seek your consent for some processing activities. If you do not
        give your consent for us to use your data for these purposes, we will

          reasons. If you object to the way in which the data controller is
          processing your personal information or if you wish to ask the data
          controller to stop processing your personal data, please contact the
